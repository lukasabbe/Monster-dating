Oh, I really don't want to talk about it.
But you have been nice to me, so why not
Its very embarrassing 
I had hair once,
and we demons use real combs that are made out of metal.
I was not very careful once and fell over in my bathroom, 
and the comb went up in the air and gained insane speed
and fell right on my right horn when I was on the floor,
and it went right off!
So now you know.
