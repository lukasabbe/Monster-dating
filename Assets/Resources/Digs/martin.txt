Hello, my name is Martin!

Nice to meat you. I hope you have made some good food for us,
I am starving, but first I need to ask you something.

Can I ask you something, it's about my appearance
You don't think the broken horn is off-putting?
_ask; pen_horn|I did notice, you look a bit wack without it; half_horn| I did notice, what happened?; pos_horn|No I don't! It doesn't bother me

_label; pen_horn
_event;change_rep;float|-0,40
Okay now you are just rude!
Do you like anything with my appearance?
_ask; pen_app|No; half_app|Yes, I like your defined eyebrows!; pos_app|Yes I like your goatee

_label; pen_app
Okay bye, I am leaving!
You are the rudest person I have met in a long time!
_end;

_label; half_app
_event;change_rep;float|0,1
Oh, thank you, I never thought about them!
_jump to; move_on

_label; pos_app
_event;change_rep;float|0,35
Thank you, I trim it every day!
_jump to; move_on

_label; half_horn
Oh, I really don't want to talk about it.
But you have been nice to me, so why not
Its very embarrassing 
I had hair once,
and we demons use combs that are made out of metal.
I was not very careful once and fell over in my bathroom, 
and the comb went up in the air and gained insane speed
and landed right on my horn, and it went off!
So now you know.
